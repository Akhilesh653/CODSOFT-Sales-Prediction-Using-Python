# CODSOFT-Sales-Prediction-Using-Python
This project predicts future sales based on historical data using machine learning. It leverages libraries such as pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. The model can be trained on various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest). The goal is to help businesses forecast sales for better decision-making. To use, clone the repository, install dependencies, and follow the example scripts for training and prediction.
